# Audio Folder

This folder is used to store temporary audio files recorded and generated by Skuggi.

Files saved here include:
- `local_input.wav` from your mic
- `tts_output.mp3` for text-to-speech
- `demon_output.wav` processed for playback

These files are **auto-deleted** after each interaction and **ignored** in Git via `.gitignore`.

This README ensures the folder is visible in the repository.
